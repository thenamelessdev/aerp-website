        The raid was september 1 (i think) by universe (former co-owner) and KingRobbie (former owner assistant). <br>
        The main readon is because universe after being removed from the staff team he opened a ticket and told us to delete all the things that he made and we said no. <br>
        After some arguing we decided to remove him from the server and we tought that it ended but it didn't. <br>
        After 1-2 days we got raided under a minute.
